# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Tutor AI Chat is a web-based application that provides personalized AI tutoring through a conversational interface. The system will allow users to create accounts, authenticate securely, and engage in educational conversations with an AI tutor. The application will feature Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities to provide contextually relevant and accurate responses based on curated educational content. The backend will be built using Python Flask, and the frontend will use Next.js to deliver a modern, responsive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a student, I want to create an account and securely log in, so that I can access personalized tutoring sessions and maintain my learning history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the signup page THEN the system SHALL display a registration form requiring email, password, and confirmation password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new account and send a confirmation email
3. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum security requirements (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)
5. WHEN a registered user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the chat interface
6. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent access
7. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session securely across page refreshes

### Requirement 2: AI Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a student, I want to send messages to an AI tutor and receive helpful responses, so that I can get assistance with my learning questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display a clean messaging interface with input field and chat history
2. WHEN a user types a message and submits it THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat history immediately
3. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL send the message to the AI service and display a loading indicator
4. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat history with proper formatting
5. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
6. WHEN a user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context for coherent responses
7. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL preserve their recent chat history

### Requirement 3: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

**User Story:** As a student, I want the AI tutor to provide accurate, contextually relevant information from educational resources, so that I receive high-quality tutoring based on verified content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a user query THEN it SHALL search relevant educational content from the knowledge base
2. WHEN relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL use it to augment the AI's response generation
3. WHEN no relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL rely on the base AI model while indicating limited context
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL prioritize information from the RAG knowledge base over general AI knowledge
5. WHEN displaying AI responses THEN the system SHALL optionally indicate when information comes from specific sources
6. WHEN the knowledge base is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect new information in subsequent queries
7. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL maintain response quality and relevance through effective retrieval mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Session Management and History

**User Story:** As a student, I want my chat sessions to be saved and accessible, so that I can review previous conversations and continue learning from past interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new chat session THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation thread
2. WHEN a user sends messages THEN the system SHALL save all messages and responses to their personal history
3. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL display their most recent conversation by default
4. WHEN a user wants to start fresh THEN the system SHALL provide an option to create a new conversation thread
5. WHEN a user has multiple conversations THEN the system SHALL allow them to navigate between different chat sessions
6. WHEN displaying chat history THEN the system SHALL show timestamps and maintain chronological order
7. WHEN a user logs out and back in THEN the system SHALL preserve their conversation history across sessions

### Requirement 5: System Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a student, I want the tutoring system to respond quickly and reliably, so that my learning experience is smooth and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL respond within 10 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL maintain functionality and provide appropriate feedback about delays
3. WHEN the AI service is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them when service resumes
4. WHEN users access the application simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent sessions without performance degradation
5. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them appropriately and display user-friendly error messages
6. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain 99% uptime during business hours
7. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL ensure secure storage and transmission of all personal information
